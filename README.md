# Radix-Tree
Radix Tree implementation using C++

The Radix Tree is a trie data stucture where each node that is the only child is merged with its parent. The Radix Tree acts as a compressed trie in this way.

The source code can be seen in RadixTree.C. The whole project demonstrates how a dating app was built that matches users with each other based on common interests.

The source code for profiles can be seen in Person Profile. The MemberDatabase file holds the pre-processed information about all the users while AttributeTranslator processes the information for use in the app.
